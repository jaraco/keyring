0.8
---

* Mac OS X keyring backend now uses subprocess calls to the `security`
  command instead of calling the API, which with the latest updates, no
  longer allows Python to invoke from a virtualenv. Fixes issue #13.
* When using file-based storage, the keyring files are no longer stored
  in the user's home directory, but are instead stored in platform-friendly
  locations (`%localappdata%\Python Keyring` on Windows and according to
  the freedesktop.org Base Dir Specification
  (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/python_keyring` or `$HOME/.local/share/python_keyring`)
  on other operating systems). This fixes #21.

*Backward Compatibility Notice*

Due to the new storage location for file-based keyrings, keyring 0.8
supports backward compatibility by automatically moving the password
files to the updated location. In general, users can upgrade to 0.8 and
continue to operate normally. Any applications that customize the storage
location or make assumptions about the storage location will need to take
this change into consideration. Additionally, after upgrading to 0.8,
it is not possible to downgrade to 0.7 without manually moving
configuration files. In 1.0, the backward compatibilty
will be removed.

0.7.1

* Removed non-ASCII characters from README and CHANGES docs (required by
  distutils if we're to include them in the long_description). Fixes #55.

---

* Python 3 is now supported. All tests now pass under Python 3.2 on
  Windows and Linux (although Linux backend support is limited). Fixes #28.
* Extension modules on Mac and Windows replaced by pure-Python ctypes
  implementations. Thanks to Jerome Laheurte.
* WinVaultKeyring now supports multiple passwords for the same service. Fixes
  #47.
* Most of the tests don't require user interaction anymore.
* Entries stored in Gnome Keyring appears now with a meaningful name if you try
  to browser your keyring (for ex. with Seahorse)
* Tests from Gnome Keyring no longer pollute the user own keyring.
* `keyring.util.escape` now accepts only unicode strings. Don't try to encode
  strings passed to it.
